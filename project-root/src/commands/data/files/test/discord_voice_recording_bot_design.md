**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the end-to-end design and implementation plan for a Discord voice recording bot, from setup through recording, diarization, transcription, and error handling. It is structured to provide all necessary technology, dependencies, and coding steps without including actual code snippets.

**2. Architecture Overview**

1. **Bot Framework & Event Loop**
   - Use `discord.py` (or a maintained fork) to connect, authenticate, and listen to voice channel events.
   - Implement as an asynchronous application driven by `asyncio`.

2. **Audio Capture Layer**
   - Spawn per-user audio streams when users speak.
   - Buffer and multiplex into a single continuous WAV file of the session.

3. **Diarization & Preprocessing**
   - After recording completes (or at intervals), run speaker diarization to segment speakers.
   - Use `pyannote.audio` for diarization models.
   - Normalize and encode audio segments to 16 kHz mono WAV.

4. **Transcription**
   - Feed diarized segments to Whisper (OpenAI's `whisper` Python package).
   - Collect per-segment transcripts with timestamps and speaker labels.

5. **Post-Processing & Storage**
   - Merge transcripts into a single, speaker-attributed meeting log.
   - Store raw audio, diarization metadata, and transcripts to local disk or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).

**3. Dependencies & Imports**

- **Core Bot & Async**
  - `discord` (discord.py)
  - `asyncio`

- **Audio I/O & Encoding**
  - `pydub` or `ffmpeg-python` for encoding/decoding
  - System-level `ffmpeg` installed

- **Speaker Diarization**
  - `pyannote.audio` and its pretrained pipelines
  - `torch` or `tensorflow` backend

- **Transcription**
  - `whisper` (OpenAI)
  - `numpy` for array manipulation

- **Utilities**
  - `logging` for structured logs
  - `os`, `pathlib` for file management
  - `json` or `yaml` for metadata
  - `datetime` for timestamps

**4. Detailed Implementation Steps**

1. **Setup & Authentication**
   - Create a Discord application and bot account; obtain the token.
   - Configure environment variables (e.g., `DISCORD_TOKEN`).
   - Initialize `discord.Client` or `commands.Bot` with appropriate intents (`voice_states`).

2. **Voice Channel Join/Leave Handlers**
   - Listen for `on_voice_state_update` events.
   - When the bot is summoned (via command or auto-join), connect to the specified voice channel.
   - Gracefully handle failures (e.g., missing permissions, voice channel full) with try/except and user feedback.

3. **Audio Stream Capturing**
   - On `VoiceClient` connection, subscribe to `VoiceClient.listen()` hooks.
   - For each `discord.AudioData` packet, demultiplex per-speaker and append to in-memory buffers.
   - Implement rotating file buffers for long sessions (e.g., split every hour).
   - Fallback: if buffer overruns or encoding fails, drop oldest packets and log warnings.

4. **Saving Raw Recordings**
   - Upon session end (e.g., bot leaves or command issued), flush buffers to WAV files.
   - Invoke `ffmpeg` to ensure correct sampling rate and format.
   - Confirm file integrity; retry with exponential backoff on I/O errors.

5. **Speaker Diarization Pipeline**
   - Load `pyannote.audio` pretrained speaker diarization pipeline.
   - Pass the WAV file (or chunks) to the pipeline; collect `(start, end, speaker_id)` segments.
   - Export diarization JSON metadata alongside audio files.
   - Error fallback: if diarization fails, tag entire audio as `speaker_unknown` and proceed.

6. **Transcription with Whisper**
   - Load Whisper model (e.g., `base` or `small` for speed vs accuracy trade‑off).
   - For each diarized segment, extract the audio via `pydub` or `ffmpeg-python`, then invoke `whisper.transcribe()`.
   - Collect `text`, `start`, `end`, and assign speaker label from diarization metadata.
   - Retry on network or GPU memory errors; fall back to CPU mode if GPU runs out of memory.

7. **Compiling Final Transcript**
   - Sort segments chronologically; merge adjacent segments by same speaker.
   - Structure as:
     1. **[00:00:05] Speaker_1:** Hello everyone...
     2. **[00:00:12] Speaker_2:** Hi...
   - Save as `.txt` and `.json` for downstream consumption.

8. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Centralize logging configuration at INFO level; use WARNING/ERROR for issues.
   - Wrap each asynchronous block with try/except, logging exceptions with stack traces.
   - On critical failures (e.g., loss of voice connection), attempt reconnection up to 3 times with delay.
   - Notify a designated text channel on persistent failures.

**5. Configuration & Deployment**

1. **Configuration File**
   - Define bot settings (token, model sizes, file paths) in a YAML/JSON file.
2. **Dockerization (Optional)**
   - Base image: Python 3.10+ with `ffmpeg` installed.
   - Mount host directories for persistent storage.
3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Linting with `flake8` or `black`.
   - Unit tests for audio processors, diarization mocks, transcription stubs.

**6. Testing & Validation**

- **Local Simulation**: Use prerecorded multi-speaker audio to test diarization and transcription.
- **Integration Test**: Join test voice channel, speak with multiple users, verify end-to-end logs.
- **Error Scenarios**: Simulate dropped packets, force model failures, and verify graceful recovery.

**7. Next Steps**

- Extend diarization to real‑time speaker labeling overlays.
- Integrate with RAG context manager: feed transcripts directly into Discord document management.
- Add user-level commands for partial transcript retrieval.

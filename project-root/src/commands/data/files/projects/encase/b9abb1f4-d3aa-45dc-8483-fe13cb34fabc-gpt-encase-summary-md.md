## **Core Product Idea**

  

**Encase** is an **AI-powered interview preparation platform** with a clear focus on building confidence, structure, and practical skill development for job aspirants. It is _not_ just another question bank or mock test tool—Encase is a **highly structured, psychologically-aware, interactive system** designed to guide users through the chaos of job prep with tailored, incremental learning tools.

  

You describe it as **“the system I wish I had when preparing for interviews.”**

  

At its heart, Encase blends **training, tracking, and emotional support**, helping users navigate not just technical prep but their **mental state, self-expression, and motivation cycles.**

## **Current Phase (June 2025)**

  

You are deep into **Encase 2.0 Revamp**, focusing on:

✔ **Double-diamond UX process** with iterative convergence-divergence phases

✔ Design of high-impact **feature groups** aligned with user emotional states and cognitive load

✔ Heavy focus on **UI/UX**, **visual language**, and **mock-interview experience improvement**

  

You’re integrating everything you’ve learned from past Encase versions into a system that feels:

- Minimal, clear, and motivating

- Flexible enough for your B2B and B2C ambitions

## **Target User**

  

Primarily **job aspirants**, especially:

- College students
    
- Early-career professionals
    
- Possibly exploring **B2B partnerships** with universities or coaching centers for mass adoption
    

  

You also want to design with **student psychology in mind**, recognizing:

- Fear of rejection
    
- Overwhelm with the job market
    
- Cognitive and emotional fatigue
    

  

Your Card Sorting exercise (June 2025) maps features to these emotional states to inform **information architecture** and UX flow.

## **Product’s Future Vision (Yash’s Words)**

  

> _“I want Encase to be the system that helps people face the world with confidence, not just throw them into tests. It should give them structure, track their progress, help them articulate themselves, and remind them they can do this — even on their bad days.”_

  

You see Encase evolving into a **trusted learning companion**, blending AI, coaching, and motivational design — a product that’s _practical_, _emotionally aware_, and built with **user growth, not corporate greed**, at its core.
